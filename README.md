For this challenge we were asked to create a dashboard to help visualize bacterial data for each volunteer in a "belly button biodiversity" study.  

### Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
Using your knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js,
- [x] create a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. 
- [x] The horizontal bar chart will display the `sample_values` as the values, the `otu_ids` as the labels, and the `otu_labels` as the hover text for the bars on the chart.

### Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart
Using your knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, create a bubble chart that will display the following when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage:

- [x] The `otu_ids` as the x-axis values.
- [x] The `sample_values` as the y-axis values.
- [x] The `sample_values` as the marker size.
- [x] The `otu_ids` as the marker colors.
- [x] The `otu_labels` as the hover-text values.


### Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart
Using your knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, 
- [x] create a gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value, 
- [x] and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.

### Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard
Use your knowledge of HTML and Bootstrap to customize the webpage for your dashboard
1. Customize your dashboard with three of the following: (changes I implemented are in **bold**)

  - [x] **Add an image to the jumbotron.**
  - [x] **Add background color or a variety of compatible colors to the webpage.**

  - [ ] Add information about what each graph visualizes, either under or next to each graph.
  - [x] **Make the webpage mobile-responsive.**
  - [ ] Change the layout of the page.
  - [ ] Add a navigation bar that allows you to select the bar or bubble chart on the page.
 
2. When the dashboard is first opened in a browser, 
 - [x] ID 940’s data should be displayed in the dashboard, 
 - [x] and the three charts should be working according to their requirements.

3. When a sample is selected, 
- [x] the dashboard should display the data in the panel 
- [x] and all three charts according to their requirements.
